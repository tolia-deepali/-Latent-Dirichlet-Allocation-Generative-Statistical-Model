### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

#### Task :
Implement  Latent  Dirichlet  Allocation  (LDA)  and  inspect  its performance both in an unsupervised manner and when used as a preprocessing step for supervised learning.

Goals for this task are to
(i) implement the collapsed Gibbs sampler for LDA inference, and

(ii) compare the LDA topic representation to a “bag-of-words” representation with respect to how well they support document classification.

#### Run the Code :
Give the following parameters in the command line with the file name:
```
\python3 pp4.py sub-directory_name** index.csv
```
sub directory of pp4data that you want to run

```
Example:
\python3 pp4.py 20newsgroups index.csv
```
#### Expected results:

topicwords.csv file

Time required for Gibbs sampling

Time required for both the representation
